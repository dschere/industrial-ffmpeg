This project is intented to be part of clustering project to create a video
distribution and management system. However, this portion of the project is
generic enough to be a project in its own right. And should be easilly modified
to suite some other purpose which is why I have created this project.

While this serice is designed for the raspberry pi it can be used on any ffmpeg
supported platform (without the omx hardware acceleration).


Features:

1) transcoding
    (optimized for the target hardware rasberry pi 3, rock64, intel ect)
2) bad video detection
3) alert system when video/network faults found
4) detailed stats including redementary AI for picture  quality analysis (blank screen, frozen, fuzzy ect)

Simple configuration using a jason configuration file.
